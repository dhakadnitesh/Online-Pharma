          Patha or Laghupatha is an Indian traditional medicine whose roots are
          used for medicinal purposes. It helps to manage diarrhea by preventing
          the growth of bacteria responsible for causing diarrhea, as well as
          prevent the loss of fluid from the body due to its antimicrobial and
          antidiarrheal properties. Patha helps to manage asthma by enhancing
          immunity and preventing inflammation of the respiratory passages due
          to its immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties. This clears
          the blockage of respiratory passages and helps to release mucus.
          Ayurveda also supports its use for managing cough due to its Kapha
          balancing property. Taking Patha powder along with honey twice daily
          helps to clear mucus which provides relief from the symptoms of cough
          and asthma. Patha powder also helps to improve male sexual health due
          to its Vrishya (aphrodisiac) properties and is also useful for
          managing menstrual problems like pain or cramps during periods due to
          its Vata balancing property. Patha helps in managing various skin
          problems like infections and dermatitis due to its antimicrobial and
          anti-inflammatory properties. Applying Patha paste along with honey
          promotes faster wound healing due to its Ropan (healing) property.
          Rubbing Patha paste along with honey on your gums and teeth also helps
          to get relief from toothache and swelling[2-4].
