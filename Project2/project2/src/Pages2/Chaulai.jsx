          Chaulai is a short-lived perennial plant which belongs to the family
          Amaranthaceae. The grains of this plant contain calcium, iron, sodium,
          potassium, vitamins A, E, C, and folic acid. Chaulai is considered
          beneficial for anemia as it increases the blood production due to its
          rich iron content. It also improves bone health and prevents
          osteoporosis as it is rich in calcium and improves bone density.
          Chaulai might help manage weight by maintaining a good digestive
          health and suppressing hunger due to its high fiber and protein
          content as well as mild laxative property. It also boosts immunity and
          prevents various infections due to the presence of vitamin C in it.
          Chaulai leaves are generally cooked and eaten as a vegetable to
          promote eye health due to the high amount of carotenoid and vitamin A
          present in it. It is also beneficial for pregnant women as it helps in
          the development of the fetus as well as post delivery recovery due to
          the presence of iron and other minerals in it. Chaulai leaf paste can
          be applied on wounds to promote wound healing and on the skin to
          prevent the signs of aging due to its antioxidant and
          anti-inflammatory properties. Chaulai leaf paste should be mixed with
          rose water or honey before application on skin to avoid
          allergies[1-3].
