          Kutaki is a small perennial herb and a fast depleting high-value
          medicinal plant that grows in the hilly parts of the North-Western
          Himalayan region of India and in Nepal. The leaf, bark and underground
          parts of the plant, mainly rhizomes are used for their medicinal
          properties in Ayurveda. Kutaki is mainly used for liver disorders like
          jaundice as it protects the liver against cell damage caused by free
          radicals due to its antioxidant and hepatoprotective properties. This
          antioxidant property along with cardioprotective activity also helps
          to improve heart health by preventing damage to the heart. Kutaki
          powder along with honey can be taken twice a day to manage the
          symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis such as joint pain and inflammation
          due to its anti-inflammatory property. Gargling with Kutaki kwath
          (decoction) helps manage stomatitis (painful swelling inside the
          mouth) due to its Ropan (healing) property and Sita (nature). Kutaki
          powder along with coconut oil or rose water can be applied on wounds
          to promote faster healing[1][2][5][15].
